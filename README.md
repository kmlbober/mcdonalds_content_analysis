## About

This project was created in June 2021 as a part of the University of Warsaw class _CSR - non-financial reporting_.

The purpose of this project was to identify the areas of McDonald's activity which customers/employees complain about on Twitter.

Analysis was divided into 5 stages:
1) Connecting to Twitter API and downloading tweets about McDonald's with `Tweepy` - from **01/05/2021** to **20/05/2021**.
2) Creating dataframe with downloaded data by using `Pandas`. 
3) Cleaning data with regex: dropping duplicates, deleting URLs, unnecessary spaces, and user tags.
4) Performing Sentiment Analysis with `NLTK`'s lexicon VADER and extracting only the negative tweets by using the `.loc function`.
5) Building the LDA model to generate the most popular topics based on content of negative tweets about McDonald's.

## Findings
